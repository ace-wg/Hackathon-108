# Hackathon-108

The following ACE related projects are in the planning for the Hackathon week prior to IETF 108.
The exact dates/times will be added to this document as they are selected.

## ACE Access Control for Resource Directory

Use the ACE-OAuth protocol for the purpose of granting access control to a Resource Directory for both registration and lookup operations.
Look at both a capabile installer application and a fairly dumb device.

## OSCORE Group Communication

Testing of draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm to do key derivation for contexts and send messages between different entities.
The intention is to mostly do unicast testing for client-server but if the VPN works well we might try multicast testing as well.

## Group KDC interactions

Testing of draft-ietf-ace-key-groupcomm-oscore to see if we think this document is ready for WG Last Call.
